# Asyncio Throttler

`asyncio` and `async`/`await` are pretty awesome tools! Asynchronous stuff!
In Python! Without insanity!

Well, unfortunately given the nature of this style of programming it's not
bloody easy sometimes.

Well, this project provides at least one tool to help ya out in a reasonably
simple way.

*asyncio_throttler* is a throttling system for Python 3.5+, designed aiohttp
throttling in mind but designed to be flexible enough to handle most throttling
and rate limiting needs.

## Usage

Well, get it:

```
$ pyvenv env/
$ . env/bin/activate
$ pip install asyncio_throttler # Pin the damned version in setup.py
                                # you bloody savage.
```

If you don't have Python 3.5, check out [pyenv](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv)
(not to be confused with py**v**env), a Python version manager similar to rbenv.

If you really don't want pyenv, `brew install python3` will non-destructively
install Python 3.5+.

Anyways, here's the terrible usage example I wrote while developing the thing.
The code is well documented, concise, and hopefully easily understandable by
humans, but this should getcha started. I'll make better docs, I promise. I
gotta sleep at some point.

**WARNING: THIS WILL NEVER COMPLETE, THE THROTTLE ERROR WILL BOUNCE AROUND
FOREVER. ON PURPOSE. TO DEMONSTRATE THINGS DON'T GET LOST. SERIOUSLY.**

```python
"""Dump test module I built while writing this thing. Need to make real tests,
but whatcha gonna do ya got schedules and stuff amirite?

"""
import logging
import asyncio
from asyncio_throttler import Throttler, ThrottleException

# Demonstrates that windowing, throttling, and every other known feature
# works, I think.
if __name__ == '__main__':
    logger = logging.getLogger('testthrottler')
    logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
    handler = logging.StreamHandler()
    format_template = '%(asctime)s:%(name)s:%(levelname)s â€“ %(message)s'
    handler.setFormatter(logging.Formatter(fmt=format_template,
                                           datefmt='%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'))
    logger.addHandler(handler)

    async def dummy_consumer(item):
        print("Item received:", item)
        await asyncio.sleep(2)

    import random
    async def dummy_task():
        logger.info("Executed")
        return await asyncio.sleep(1, random.randrange(1, 1000))

    async def bad_dummy_task():
        logger.info("Executed and gonna throw a throttle")
        raise ThrottleException(bad_dummy_task())

    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()

    # roflcoptr
    todo_list = [dummy_task() for _ in range(1, 31)]
    todo_list.append(bad_dummy_task())
    todo_list = todo_list + [dummy_task() for _ in range(1, 31)]

    throttler = Throttler(
        todo_list,
        dummy_consumer,
        time_window=10,
        per_time_window=20,
        concurrency=5,
        log_handler=logging.StreamHandler(),
        log_level=logging.DEBUG,
        loop=loop
    )

    loop.run_until_complete(throttler.run())
    loop.close()
```

## How's It Works

A Throttler is instantiated with a list of awaitables, an async function, and
numerous keyword arg knobs you adjust to suit your purposes.

Inside are two `asyncio.Queue` objects, and one `asyncio.LifoQueue`.

* `exceptions` is a `Queue` for non-throttle exceptions we catch.
* `processed` is a `Queue` for processed output. This is what your consumer
  will consume from.
* `todo` is a `LifoQueue` that holds your unprocessed task list. It's initially
  fed from a `reverse` of the list you pass to `Throttler`, which is fast and
  an iterator. It's `LIFO` just so we can pop throttled items back into it at
  the front.

Several internal functions are composed to create an async producer and
consumer loop where items are processed as fast as possible given the
restrictions imposed at `Throttler` instantiation. It'll backoff `time_window`
when throttled, only execute `concurrency` of your tasks at a time, and will
wait `time_window` after triggering the processing of `per_time_window` items.

That oughta cover a few cases...

Anyways, the async `consumer_fn` you pass in will be executed as results become
available, immediately, for writing to disk or somethin'.


## Notes

This was painful.
